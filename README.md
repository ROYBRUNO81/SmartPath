The app will serve as a tool to help students build and manage their own schedules.

When launched, the app will display basic student information along with the current semester’s schedule. A dedicated “4-Year Plan” tab will allow students to customize their academic roadmap and view summaries such as semester difficulty, total course hours, and credit counts.

There will also be a “Courses” tab where students can browse and add courses. The “Add Course” button will trigger the getCourseDetail function to auto-fill course information, which students can later edit if needed.

Overall, the app is designed to support students in managing their courses and fulfilling major requirements more effectively.
